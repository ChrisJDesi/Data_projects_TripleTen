# TripleTen Sprint 2 Project - EDA

### Instacart Orders

This is the 2nd project I worked on in the TripleTen Data Science program. This project was the most independent project I've worked on so far, and I loved it.

I first explored the dataset to find and fix missing and duplicate values, and I merged DataFrames from different sources. Finally, I analyzed the data using visualizations and pivot tables.

Taking the time to explain my results at each step was a key element in this process, and this was my first attempt at doing it. I wrote an introduction and conclusion that outlined what I did, and made suggestions for Instacart to consider in the future.

### Data Usage

The data is provided by TripleTen, who took it from Kaggle and modified it.
